### Installation Instructions

#### Basics

  * If your machine doesn't already have it, you might need to [install libgmp](http://www.mathemagix.org/www/mmdoc/doc/html/external/gmp.en.html)
  * [Download Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/)
  * Ensure that you have a working version of Postgres, by checking that `psql --version` and `pg_config --version` print version numbers; if not, your installation is probably broken, and fixing that will be addressed in the next section of this document

#### General Postgres Setup

  * [Download Postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
    * This application has been tested on various versions of Postgres, 9 through 17, without issue, but there is the possibility of problems from version mismatches

  * If you get an error in the coming steps that says "Missing C library: pq" or about a missing `pg_config`, you need to get Postgres stuff onto your `PATH`
    * On Amazon Linux 2023, this can be achieved with `yum install libpq-devel --allowerasing`, in order to get a working version of `pg_config`
    * On Red Hat, this can be accomplished by installing `postgresql*-devel` through `yum`
    * On Ubuntu, it can be something more like `apt install postgresql-server-dev-9.6`

  * Ensure that the Postgres server is running by performing `ps aux | grep postgres` and looking for a `postgres` process; it's probably not running, so you can follow [these instructions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/static/server-start.html) or the more-targeted guide below, where we manually set up basically everything
    * Setting up the `postgres` user
      * Make sure that the `postgres` user exists
      * Add `postgres` to any groups that you might want it to have
      * Use `passwd` to give the `postgres` user the password that you want
        * Launching the server as `postgres` on startup will be easiest with an empty password, so remove any password: `sudo passwd -d postgres`
          * If you're going to do this, first ensure in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` that this user cannot log in over SSH by adding the line `DenyUsers postgres` and then restarting SSH with `sudo service ssh restart`
    * Make the data directory: `sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/pgsql/data`
    * Make a log directory: `sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/pgsql/log`
    * User `chmod`/`chown`/`chgrp` to set permissions on the data directory (probably make `postgres` the owner of the directory)
    * Initialize the datastore: `su postgres -c "initdb -D /usr/local/pgsql/data"`
    * Ensure that Postgres will launch at startup
      * This is a whole kerfuffle, involving adding this line to `/etc/rc.local`: `su postgres -c 'pg_ctl start -D /usr/local/pgsql/data/' -l /usr/local/pgsql/log/logfile.log`
      * The reason this turned into a kerfuffle on Amazon Linux 2023 was because `rc.local` was not set up as expected
        * Use `sudo systemctl status rc-local` to diagnose; values other than `Active: active` indicate error
    * Run whatever your startup script is (e.g. `/etc/rc.local`, if this Postgres-related stuff is all that's in it) to finally launch Postgres

#### zócalo-Specific Postgres Setup

  * Next, you'll need to initialize the Postgres database tables
    * Run `psql --username=postgres`
      * `CREATE DATABASE zocalo WITH ENCODING='UTF8' CONNECTION LIMIT=-1;`
      * `CREATE DATABASE badgerstate WITH ENCODING='UTF8' CONNECTION LIMIT=-1;`
      * `exit`

  * Set up auth files
    * `cd <root of repository>`
    * `touch .db_username .db_password`
    * Use your preferred editor to set the sole contents of `.db_username` to your Postgres username (default: `postgres`)
    * Use your preferred editor to set the sole contents of `.db_password` to your Postgres password (default: ``)

#### Keeping Secrets

  * Run `head -c 32 /dev/urandom | base64 > .app_secret.txt` to set up an application secret
  * From [Mailtrap](https://mailtrap.io/settings/api-tokens), get your API token and place it into `.mailtrap_secret.txt`

### Running

  * To run the server without HTTP, run `stack build && stack exec run-zocalo`

  * For HTTPS support, ensure that your SSL cert is accessible and run this command: `stack build && sudo /PATH/TO/STACK/stack exec --allow-different-user run-zocalo -- --port=80 --ssl-port=443 --ssl-cert=/PATH/TO/CERT/cert.pem --ssl-key=/PATH/TO/KEY/privkey.pem --ssl-address=0.0.0.0 --no-ssl-chain-cert` (your filenames for the key and cert may differ)
